# Lucky Seven
The rules of this simple card game are as follows:
Each player draws a hand of seven random cards and they do not know their oppponent's cards
Each player has to put down a card that they think has a lower value than the other player 
Whoever puts down the lowest card value than their opponent gets a point and they each draw a single card to continue the game
The game continues in this pattern until a player accumulates seven points, the winning score
Each player will always have seven cards in their hand, so as to not have any issues trying to get to the winning score
